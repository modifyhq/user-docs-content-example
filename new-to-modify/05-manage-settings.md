## Manage settings

### Teams

You can manage your team settings by clicking Manage teams in the breadcrumb's Team dropdown.

Click on the team's name and use the tabs to manage your workspaces, team members and connector credentials.

On the Members tab, you can send email invites to new members, and manage invites and team members.

### Workspaces

To manage a workspace, click on the workspace name on the Mission Control page.

To manage workspace branches, select Manage branches in the breadcrumb's connector dropdown.

### Connectors

To manage connectors, select the Manage connectors label in the breadcrumb's connector dropdown or navigate to the connector page using the left navigation.

You can add and remove connectors to and from your base branch only, so make sure you're on this branch first using the breadcrumb or navigation links.

# User docs

## Why user docs?

Every software project needs user docs. Getting these right is important for increasing adoption, external contributions and revenue. For developer-facing projects and companies, it's a key part of the developer experience. 

## Challenges 

Common challenges creating user docs with using available tools:

- No native support for MDX
- Synchronous or async collab, rarely both
- No version control 
- No control of build and publish steps

Obviously, you'll still need to do the work to write your docs, which takes effort to get right, but the pay-off is huge when you do! And using MDX can make that *fun*!

## Why Modify?

Modify solves these in a few ways:

- Real-time collaboration in MDX or markdown, with comments and reviews in the pipe for async collab
- Everything is stored in Git. Use your own repos in GitHub or Bitbucket so you stay in control of your data.
- Build and publish websites with your favourite site generators (e.g. Next, Docusaurus, Gatsby) and cloud services (e.g. GitHub, Netlify, Vercel)
- Build and publish to other formats - PDF, epub, whatever!

You can read more on features in [index].

## Docs 

The docs in this repo are a work in progress. Modify is evolving fast, and so are our docs. 

They will be published soon as a website using [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), and we'll also be releasing the job we use to do this as an OSS example for you to use for your own docs!

## Feedback

We'd love to hear your feedback on how we can improve our content and tooling to help you better!

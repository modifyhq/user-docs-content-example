# User docs

## Why user docs?

Software products or projects without user docs usually struggle to get traction, as users tend not to use them if they don't understand:

- why it exists
- how they can get it set up
- how to use it once set up

Those with good user docs, on the other hand, stand a fighting chance.

## Challenges 

Common challenges facing software teams when preparing user docs include:

- Tools and workflows used for code don't get used for docs, which can mean sub-optimal developer participation
- Editing experience that can be used by developers and members of wider team
- No choice of keeping existing build and publish pipelines

## Why Modify?

Modify solves these challenges in a few ways:

- Create, build and publish docs using plain text (markdown, MDX, yaml), Git and popular build tools (static sites, CI services)
- Plain text editor with simple, Git-like collaboration workflow 
- Keep your build and publish pipelines, or create new ones, it's upto you 

## Docs 

This repo contains a selection of Modify's own user docs. This is an early iteration that is likely to change as the beta progresses.

## Feedback

We'd love to hear your feedback on how we can improve our content and tooling to support your user docs efforts!

# Modify

## Why Modify?

Modify is a modern publishing worflow for software teams. 

What's different about Modify is that it helps software teams manage content with the tools they already know and love.

<InfoMessage header="Key differentiator" content="With Modify, software teams get to use markdown/MDX, Git and popular build tools to create, build and publish content."/>

## Features

- **Text editor with real-time collaboration** - powerful text editor that supports real-time collaboration between teammates 
- **Markdown and MDX** - create docs in markdown, and add React components using MDX to enrich docs visually.
- **Yaml registers** - version controlled tabular data in yaml with schemas, and changes that can be preview using the register GUI.
- **Git connectors** - read-write integrations with Git repositories hosted in Modify, GitHub and Bitbucket (with OAuth  external providers) for version control and users staying in control of their data. 
- **Front matter** - supported in markdown, MDX and yaml files for improved searching and referencing
- **Configurable layouts** - configure layouts with editor, preview, register, card and form views. Users can choose what interface works best for them.
- **Artifact search** - search for artifacts using `id` and `title` fields defined in front matter
- **Relationships** - defined in text and visualise as a graph that can be use to navigate round docs instead of the repository's tree view.
- **Text-based diagrams** [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/), [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) and [nomnoml](https://nomnoml.com/) for version-controlled diagrams that can be created without leaving your editor.
- **Workspace branching** - branch your workspace and all its connectors to work in isolation from your team.
- **Reviews** - Review changes on a source branch and merge to a target branch once approvals and automated checks have passed.
- **Jobs** - Run build and publish jobs using using popular build tools (e.g. Gatsby, NextJS) CI servies (GitHub Actions) and hosting services (Netlify, AWS S3).`

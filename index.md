# Modify

## Why Modify?

Modify helps software teams have fun creating long-form content with `<Component />`s!

## Features

- **MDX** - write in markdown, add MDX using a growing library of built-in components to enrich your docs visually. Coming soon - an npm package that will let you use our built-in MDX and other Modify syntax in your React and Vue apps, and support for third-party components, so you can bring your own! âœ¨ 
- **Collaboration** - powerful text editor that supports real-time collaboration between team mates. Coming soon - comments for adhoc review, reviews for formal review that improves upon the typical Pull Request workflow - with no PR ping pong!
- **Jobs** - Run build and publish jobs using using popular site generators (e.g. Gatsby, NextJS) and cloud services Netlify, AWS S3). We provide a number of open source examples to get you going.
- **Git** - read-write integrations with Git repositories hosted on Modify, GitHub and Bitbucket. No migration costs if your data is already stored in Git, and maximum control of your data.
- **Tables that don't suck** - No more markdown tables. Define schemas in yaml and work on the source in your editor, or use table, form and card graphical views. Version-controlled tables in text, with a GUI.
- **Relationships** - define relationships between files in text and visualise as a graph with clickable nodes.
- **Diagrams** - text-based diagrams using [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/), [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) and [nomnoml](https://nomnoml.com/).
